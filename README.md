## Project Description/Outline
  Using the Open Beer Database and Census Database analyze Craft Beer production across the US.

## Research Question to Answer
  1) WHERE are US breweries located?<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which regions/states have the most breweries?<br/>
  2) WHAT beers are US breweries making?<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the most produced styles per region?<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What region makes the strongest beers?<br/>
  5) WHY are US breweries located where they are located?<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does age, income, or population size correlate to number of breweries?

## Dataset to Be Used

  Census Dataset: https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
